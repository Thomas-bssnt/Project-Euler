Problem 19: Counting Sundays

You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research
for yourself.

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Thirty days has September,
  April, June and November.
  All the rest have thirty-one,
  Saving February alone,
  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
  And on leap years, twenty-nine.
- A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century
  unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the 20th century (1 Jan
1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
