# Project Euler

Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems range in difficulty and are a great way to enhance your problem-solving and programming skills. You can find more about it here: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## My Rules

In this repository, I follow a set of personal rules for solving the problems:

1. **Python Only**: All solutions are written in Python, specifically Python 3.12+.
2. **Standard Library Only**: I exclusively use Python's standard library to solve the problems, maximizing the use of built-in functions and modules.
3. **Pythonic Solutions**: I prioritize writing Pythonic code, embracing idiomatic practices and clear, readable syntax.
4. **Concise and Efficient**: My goal is to craft solutions that are both concise and optimized for performance, minimizing unnecessary complexity.
5. **Algorithm Generalization** Whenever possible, I generalize the algorithms to make them applicable to a broader range of inputs, such as different numbers or limits, ensuring flexibility and reusability.
