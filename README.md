# Project Euler

Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The problems range in difficulty and are a great way to enhance your problem-solving and programming skills. You can find more about it here: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## My Rules

In this repository, I follow a set of personal rules for solving the problems:

1. **Python Only**: All solutions are written in Python.
2. **Standard Library Only**: I use only Python's standard library to solve the problems.
3. **Pythonic Solutions**: I aim to write the most Pythonic code possible, adhering to the language's idiomatic practices.
4. **Concise and Efficient**: I strive to make the solutions as short and efficient as possible. If feasible, I try to implement the solution as a one-liner.
